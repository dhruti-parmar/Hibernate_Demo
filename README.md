# Hibernate_Demo
This is my first project using Hibernate.

In this project, I have learned the basics of Hibernate, including:
->How to configure hibernate.cfg.xml
->Understanding Configuration, SessionFactory, and Session
->Implementing Hibernate in a Java application
Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with these fundamental Hibernate concepts.
